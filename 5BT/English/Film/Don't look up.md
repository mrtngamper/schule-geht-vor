## Plot
Kate Dibiasky, is a doctoral candidate, discovers an unknown comet. Her professor Dr. Randall Mindy confirms that the comet will collide with the Earth in about six months and will cause a planet-wide extinction event. NASA confirms the findings. Even though officials like the president (female Trump) want't this piece of information to remain a secret, Dibiasky and Mindy leak it to the media in a talk show. The NASA  publically denies the existence of a thread. 

After a sex scandal in the white house the president tries to distract from it by reveiling the truth and announcing a project to strike and divert the comet.
The mission launches, but Peter Isherwell the CEO of BASH Cellular (Apple reference) aborts the mission, because his company discovered the existance of trillions of dollars worth of rare-earth elements in the comet.

The populatin begins to split. While some people think the comet is a severe thread, others beliefe that mining a destroyed comet will create jobs, and some deny the comet's existence. 

Dibiasky tries to mobiilize public opposition and Mindy begins adcovating the comet's commercial opportunities. As soon as the comet becomes visible from earth Mindy and Dibiasky  organize a protest campaign telling the people to "Just Look Up". At the same time the "Don't Look Up" anti-campaign stats.  BASH'S attempt at breaking the comet apart did not work.

While the most of the population dies, the rich are able to escape using a sleeper spaceship, which should find another Earth-like planet. 

## Meaning
The Plot of "Don't look up" can be seen as a metaphor  for [[Climate Change]].
