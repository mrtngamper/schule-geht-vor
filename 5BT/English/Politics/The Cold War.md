The Cold War was a political and military tension between two powerful countries, the United States and the Soviet Union, that lasted from the end of World War II until the early 1990s. It was called a "cold" war because there was no direct military conflict between the two superpowers, but there was a constant threat of war and both sides were constantly preparing for it.

The Cold War started after World War II when the Soviet Union and the United States emerged as the two dominant superpowers. The two countries had very different political systems and ideologies, with the Soviet Union being communist and the United States being capitalist. The tensions between the two countries were exacerbated by a series of events, including the Soviet Union's expansion into Eastern Europe and the United States' development of nuclear weapons.

The Cold War ended in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. This was due to a combination of factors, including economic problems within the Soviet Union, political reforms within the country, and pressure from the United States and other Western countries. The end of the Cold War marked the beginning of a new era in international relations and a significant shift in the balance of power in the world.

# The Iron Curtain

Britain from 1940–1945. He made a speech in 1946,
in Missouri, USA in which he stated that an ‘iron
curtain’ had descended across the Continent. He
used the phrase to refer to the ideological and
physical boundary between Soviet-controlled
eastern Europe and western Europe.
