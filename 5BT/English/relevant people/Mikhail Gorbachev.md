# Perestroika and Glasnost 
Perestroika and Glasnost were part of a broader effort by Gorbachev to modernize and reform the Soviet Union. These policies helped to bring about significant changes in the Soviet Union and contributed to the end of [[The Cold War]].

## Perestroika
Perestroika, which means "restructuring" in Russian, was a program of economic and political reform aimed at modernizing the Soviet economy and making it more efficient. Gorbachev recognized that the Soviet economy was stagnating and inefficient, and he believed that reforms were necessary to make it more competitive in the global marketplace. Under Perestroika, Gorbachev allowed more private enterprise and foreign investment, and he tried to reduce bureaucracy and corruption in the government.

## Glasnost
Glasnost, which means "openness" in Russian, was a policy aimed at increasing transparency and openness in the Soviet government and society. Gorbachev believed that the Soviet Union needed to be more transparent and accountable to its citizens, and he implemented a number of reforms to achieve this goal. Under Glasnost, there was greater freedom of the press, more openness in government decision-making, and more discussion of sensitive topics like Soviet history and human rights.
